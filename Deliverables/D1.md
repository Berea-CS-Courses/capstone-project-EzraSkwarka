# Overview
_This section should be no more than a paragraph. It should present a concise overview that summarizes the purpose and intent of the project and describes what the world will be like when the project is completed. This overview may be somewhat idealistic, but it still should be grounded in the realities of time and resource limitations._

# Concept
_This section should very clearly specify both the scope of the project as what will be considered “out of scope”. Be sure to describe the intended major features that will be included in the project. Also, identify any product features or characteristics that a stakeholder might anticipate, but which are not planned to be included in the project._

# Requirements
_A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a written understanding of system requirements prior to any actual design or implementation work. The SRS section states in precise and explicit language those functions and capabilities a software system must provide, and any required constraints which the system must follow. An SRS contains functional and nonfunctional requirements only, rather than design ideas. Functional requirements describe the functionality or capability that the software is to have and thus describes how it works, as opposed to why or even what it does._
