# Overview
*This section should be no more than a paragraph. It should present a concise overview that summarizes the purpose and intent of the project and describes what the world will be like when the project is completed. This overview may be somewhat idealistic, but it still should be grounded in the realities of time and resource limitations.*

My goal is to create an active-incremental exploration game. I will do this by borrowing elements from the incremental genre such as snowball growth, systemic gameplay, and ***Really Big*** numbers and fusing them with the active player-driven elements of exploration games such as discovery, character advancement, and agency. I'm going to dress up these mechanics in the aesthetics of games such as *Terraria*, *Minecraft*, and *Stardew Valley* while trying to put my twist on these.

# Concept
*This section should very clearly specify both the scope of the project as what will be considered “out of scope”. Be sure to describe the intended major features that will be included in the project. Also, identify any product features or characteristics that a stakeholder might anticipate, but which are not planned to be included in the project.*

# Requirements
*A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a written understanding of system requirements prior to any actual design or implementation work. The SRS section states in precise and explicit language those functions and capabilities a software system must provide, and any required constraints which the system must follow. An SRS contains functional and nonfunctional requirements only, rather than design ideas. Functional requirements describe the functionality or capability that the software is to have and thus describes how it works, as opposed to why or even what it does.*

### Major Systems
  - Save system that preserves:
    - Map info (resource nodes, structure placement and level)
    - Player Info (level, perks, tools)
  - Inventory Management (player and placed structures)
  - Placeable Structures
  - Resource Scaling based on structure level
  - Resource Scaling based on player tools (and possibly nearby structures)
  - A curve for determining scaling (i.e. how many resources and what type needed to upgrade given structure/tool)
  - Resource node spawning (needs to consider spawn location, resource type and relative rarity)
