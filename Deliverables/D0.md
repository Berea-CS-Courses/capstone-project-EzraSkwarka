# D0 Ideas

Personally, I enjoy playing one another's idle games, for as much as it can be said that anyone plays them. I like big numbers, and I like watching them go up very fast, but one problem I have with them is that they don't encourage continuous active play by their very nature. They tend to reach a point where after you have played the game for a little while, you enter a cycle of leaving for a couple of hours, coming back, pressing three buttons, rinse repeat.  Ultimately, I want to take some of the elements of incremental value, satirical excess, and stupid big numbers and apply them to a game that encourages more active interaction. After some brainstorming and discussions with my classmates, I have a couple of different spins on this concept that I could explore.  They are in no particular order:
    - A city-building simulation.
    - An isomorphic exploration game that's kind of a riff off of Terraria/Minecraft.
    - Gamification of the classroom experience

## City Sim

Some of Logan's comments largely inspired this one, but I envision it as a tile-based city building simulator. That is to say that the map you're working with is a discrete set of tiles, and you are given a variety of buildings that you can put on each tile or set of tiles. Each of these buildings could generate either a central resource or one of a set of resources. You can increase that resource generation by building additional buildings of this type or upgrading individual buildings. I want to design this to encourage systemic gameplay; for instance, buildings are next to each other increases their productivity, or there are no landmarks that can affect how your buildings work. This one seems the most straightforward in capturing the incremental game experience, but I am struggling with ways to design it to encourage active play. That could be potentially solved by introducing mini-games, but if I were to pursue this idea, I imagine that's something I could weed out in the implementation process.
I think this could potentially work best as a low brainpower game, one you can be playing without giving it your full attention. As such, I think this would work best as a mobile app. I think this would certainly be interesting, but it doesn't really deal with the issues I'm trying to potentially solve with a game like this. Overall, I think I'd give this a 4 for enthusiasm, I'm sure I would enjoy making it, but of the ideas I have, it's not my favorite.

## Gameified Classroom

I'm not going to lie, of my three ideas, I think this one is the least fleshed-out, but that's because I don't know how to put this concept into words. Some parts of it are easier to explain; by gamification of the classroom experience, I mean creating a playable character that interacts with academia in a very abstract sense. They might get points for attending a class, doing an assignment, grading a paper, something along those lines. All the ins and outs and specifics of this game are harder for me to navigate, it does lend itself clarity for developing the renown/prestige system most incremental games have. To clarify, the Renown system is a special resource or currency that the incremental games use to signify how well you've done in a playthrough. For instance, imagine one playthrough of this game as being a four-year undergraduate degree. At graduation, you earn one Degree point, and on your next playthrough of the game, that Degree point makes it easier/quicker to complete the game again. There is, of course, more nuance to this type of system, but that's a general overview of how it works.
This is something I can easily see working well as a mobile game or as a desktop game, and I imagine it would lend itself more to active play than the city sim would, as each individual action the player must do is smaller. As far as a personal enthusiasm score, for this one, it's maybe a three but probably closer to two, a very useful thought experiment that I am glad I went through but still not quite what I'm trying to accomplish with my original goal.

## 2-D Exploration

Of my three ideas, I think this one is the one I prefer the most and have the best handle on. To explain what I mean by 2D exploration, that's just serving as a framing device for the game mechanics. This one would still borrow some of the tile-based elements from the city sim and some of the micro-interactions from the gamified classroom. I think to best explain how I envisioned this style of the game working I need to outline the core gameplay loop. In my mind, the core gameplay loop for this game will be to explore the map till you find one of the natural resources(a rock with iron ore in it), gather naturally spawning resources (breaking rock and getting iron ore), refine/process those resources in some way (smelt the iron ore into an iron bar), use the refined resource to improve your characters stats are abilities (use some number of iron bars  to make your pickaxe stronger to make gathering iron ore next time easier) repeat. Now, as for how I would actually introduce elements from incremental games into this, I think would be best accomplished using systems. For instance, let's say your characters at a point where they need to smelt iron faster. One way to accomplish this would be spending some of another resource into your furnace to make it just a little bit faster. But scale that exponentially so that eventually, all those little bits become a lot of bits. The idea is to take that rapid exponential growth seen in incremental games and apply it to the elements of an exploration game until you're working with stupid big numbers.
Now I think this would be the type of game that works best as designed for a desktop or console experience, that is to say, distinctly not a mobile experience. Mobile games tend to have certain mechanics and styles that I am not personally a fan of, and while I could simply not include these mechanics, I still think the experience would be best under the connotations of playing a PC or console game. No need to fight player expectations this way.  And like I said above, I think this is my favorite of the three ideas I came up with during the brainstorming process, and I'm going to give it a solid five for enthusiasm because the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to be able to play this kind of game.

# Summary
As I said above, the 2D exploration variation is I believe my preferred idea and the one I would like to run with. currently, I don't have any grand ideas for a narrative or anything like that, but I do have ideas for a bunch of systems that I think would work well in a game and ways to tie those systems together so that they create positive feedback loops between them. While my ideas are still there Patchwork, I do think they make a solid foundation for the type of game I'm envisioning and it also feels like something I'm capable of doing even if some of the ideas are a little bit more out there.
