# Data/Gamestate Flow Diagrams

Below I have included two-game State flow diagrams. The first is an overview of the player's very first run through the game. The second differs because after completing their first run additional content will be unlocked. Specifically, they will be able to at any time during subsequent runs venture over to the island of endless progression to push for progress into the endless tower and to speak with the shopkeep NPC to purchase/upgrade their persistent relics.

The reason for the bi-directional arrow between the two main Loops is that the player is free to take these actions at any time at any state within either Loop. At any time during the Main Island's progression, they can choose to venture over to the endless Island, and the inverse holds as well.

# Stoyboarded interactions

I've also storyboarded some important interactions.  The first and most integral interaction that storyboard it is how big will look for the player to actually break open resource nodes and how that differs at various tool levels. The short version is that to level is a positive linear correlation with resource quantity drops. That is to say at level 0 the tool does not add any increase to the percentage of dropped resources but each additional level as a 1% increase to Resource objects dropped. For example, a level 212 tool will cause a resource know to drop 312% of its bass drop rate.

The next interaction I storyboarded is very similar to the previous one, but it looks at how resource objects and structure levels interact in a previous deliverable. I have already outlines the formula for how structure level scales resource production, but the story board should give a visual example of how it actually functions.

 The last thing I have storyboarded is not a direct player interaction event, but it is the mechanics that explain how node spawning works. I know there's been some confusion when I've tried to explain words so I'm hoping a storyboard visual will help with that confusion.

#### Notes

I know that I'm submitting this assignment late, and that it's not up to par with the quality of assignments I usually submit. I've had a very difficult few weeks personally, which I express Doctor Jones in class one day but if you have any questions I will gladly answer them I just don't want to put it in a publicly-accessible forum. I'm not trying to make any excuses for this, I'm simply expressing the reason behind it. Traditionally I might spend more time adding some Polish to this assignment but considering that the midterm deliverable is coming up I feel it is probably best for me to take the L here and just  focus on that deliverable.
