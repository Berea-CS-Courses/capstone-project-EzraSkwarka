# Proof of Concept

This is an overview of both my plans and progress in creating my proof of concept for the mine refine upgrade game.

### What external software or tools are needed to run your proof-of-concept?
The obvious software that I need to create my proof of concept is the native IDE for the game engine I'm using, Game Maker Studio 2. However once I have developed my proof-of-concept and at my Benchmark points, I'll be able to export a stand-alone executable, so no additional software tools are needed to run the proof-of-concept aside from a functioning Windows computer.

### What steps would need to be taken to run your proof-of-concept?
I have a timeline checklist laid out for what I think I need to have to implement the core components of my game that will make up my proof of concept. I've detailed them below and they are intended to be implemented in sequential order of how they are listed.

### What is the current functionality of the proof of concept as you have submitted it?
 TODO


### Are there any components of the code or systems you have submitted that you did not create? If so, document them here alongside their source or reference.
