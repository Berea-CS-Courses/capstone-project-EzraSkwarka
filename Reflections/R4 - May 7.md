## 1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)
The biggest thing I accomplished this week is I put in place a structure menuing system.  It uses a newly-created dynamic button object to create control what different structures can make.


## 2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?
Full disclosure this is has been quantifiably one of the worst weeks of my life, and as such I wasn't able to get as much done on the project as I would have liked. I didn't really have any problems with the program or the class however, I simply had most of my time taken up by a couple of personal issues.


## 3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)
Over the next week, I intend to tackle both the zoning system and the Renown system. For the zoning system, I'm going to create a set of discrete tiles that can spawn different nodes on them that will supply the player with different resources using a random Generation table. For the renown system, I only intend to implement a single Relic (one that increases the players "pick power") but I intend to create the back-end system we're adding next Relic will be as simple as adding it to the relevant in numerator list and putting its variable in the appropriate place. I lost the adding a function that calculates the players Renown gained honor reset, it will simply be a placeholder function but it's going to take the total number of item objects in the player's inventory and the total level of all structures on the map, give them different lights, and feed them to a base two logarithmic function.



## 4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)
As always I will be relying on yoyo games documentation for gml to get me through this. I also feel its appropriate to state that the assets I'm using for the tile creation will be pulled from a pack I have from Humble Bundle.
