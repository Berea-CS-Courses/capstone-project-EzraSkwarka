## 1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)

This week most of what I accomplished was Research into how game maker language works. I looked into it scalability as well and how it handles complex and Abstract data types. I also found a couple of YouTube channels that offer very helpful tutorials, namely Shaun Spalding and FriendlyCosmonaut. While I don't have a whole lot of code to show for this week, I can say that I have a much more confident understanding of how gml works and how best to use it.


## 2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?

The biggest challenge or difficulty that I faced this week was determining a direction to go in. While it is true that I had deliverable two to fall back on so that I had a way to push forward, figuring out some of the smaller details on how to tackle specific issues took a little bit more figuring out. Because of the research that I have now done and the resources I have gathered, I feel more prepared to tackle these smaller steps that I've laid out for myself.


## 3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)

Next week I'm going to actually properly dive into the major issues that I'm going to handle from deliverable two.  Tell prepare myself for that I issue-ified most of the major points on that document so that I would have more specific and measurable targets. I feel like they're perfectly obtainable and reasonable in the time that I have, and I've broken them up in such a way that I expect each of them to take one full work week to complete. There is going to be some wiggle room in that because I still have such an abstract far out and you of how to accomplish these goals but I feel I've broken them down to manageable components.


## 4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)

The resources I will use to accomplish my goals will mostly be the yo-yo documentation for gml, but I will also be making heavy use of the YouTube channels I referenced for question 1.
