## 1. What have you accomplished this week? (Please list each accomplishment, and explain)

Over the last week, the largest coal that I have accomplished is the implementation of my modular structure building system. The player is now able to select the structure they would like to build from the structures backstage menu, and then place the structure that they have chosen on any non occupied hex tile in the game map. When they attempt to do this, the system does the math to make sure that the x is unoccupied, and that the player has enough materials in their inventory necessary to build the structure once it's built and placed onto the game map it will function in the same way that the example structures from the proof-of-concept worked. I've also built this system in a way that adding in additional structures will be a relatively simple process.


## 2. What challenges or difficulties did you face? If you solved them, how? If not, what have you learned so far? Have you sought help or other resources?

One challenge that I discovered in the process of implementing the system, is that creating the pop-up dialog that will allow the player to create different recipes from the same structure is a more involved process than I was hoping it would be. I've done some research into how to implement this system, and I've discovered that in order to do it it is going to be its own major milestone that will take a significant amount of work to complete as such I'm going to create a detailed GitHub issue to reflect this and give it the proper tags.


## 3. What do you plan to accomplish in the following week? (Please list at least 3 concrete "S.M.A.R.T." goals, along with estimated number of hours to complete, or day to complete)

Over the next week I plan to implement be safe system, which looks like it might be a relatively straightforward process of writing everything to a modular and scalable Json file. If that is the case I'm going to vent take some time to work on some of the minor issues I've created in my GitHub issue page. The specifics of all of these issues can be found on there issue page, so I don't necessarily feel the need to reiterate them here. That said I expected to take about 3 work days for me to implement the safe system, and I feel that the majority of the minor issues can be resolved in a rate of 2 per workday.


## 4. What resources will you use to accomplish your goals for the upcoming week? (please list out the resources)

I'm using the same resources that I have been for all of my previous work, and honestly I feel as though this reflection question would be better served if I was reflecting on the resources that I hadn't used this week as opposed to speculating on the resources I will need for the next week. I need a list of good for us all to be looking ahead and considering what we're going to need, but this almost feels like writing your bibliography before you even determine your research question.
